# Turbo-Courier<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Death Stranding<br/>
Genre: 3D Obstacle Course / Delivery<br/>
USP: Deliver packages with a hoverboard across tricky terrain and against the clock.<br/>
Main focus: Physics, movement, timer system, terrain interaction.<br/>

## General
Players explore a 3D environment in Third Person Perspective, pick up items they need to transport to another point of the map.
It should be a fun expirience to figure out the challenges of the controls to maneuver the hoverboard with efficiency through the terrain.

## Player
The player is a transporter, who uses hoverboard to transport items and collect their rewards, if they manage to do so in time.
